                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p class="coding">
                        Naturally, I have an interest in coding and persue this outside my university time.
                        Outside my lectures I've been teaching myself aspects as well as, getting tips from people I
                        know.
                        My interest in the subject grew when I started playing video games and wanted to learn more and
                        build my own pc.
                        While I never had the money to do so, I tried to do my own research so I could buy the best
                        equipment I could.
                        Also, as the sole child in the household it fell to me to solve all technical issues so I had to
                        learn how to be Tech-Support too.
                        The moment I choose to fully immerse myself in the subject, was when a friend was struggling
                        with Java and bounced ideas off of me and I found that I understood and was interested in
                        learning more.
                        I thoroughly enjoyed learning what I did in my own and when I asked a friend to teach me more, I
                        was told about my course so I took a chance and jumped on it.
                        I am glad I did and I can't wait to continue to learn and grow in the subject.<br>
                        I can't wait to get started on some projects! As soon as I have finished my course however.

                    <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
                    <p class="writing">
                        What drove me to choosing to do English originally was a fondness for writing stories. When I
                        realised I was good as Linguistics as well, I choose to do it as an undergraduate course.
                        I started writing FanFiction as a way of escapism from when I was a teenager, reading my old
                        work I know I wasn't any good but I kept going and now I am a lot better.
                        I love being creative, and I now write for others and it brings me joy when other people read my
                        work and are happy.
                        On various sites, I get requests for certain "Fandoms" and practise my writing this way. I even
                        prepare for writing assignments this way too!
                        Eventually, like all young writers, I turned my hand to writing novels. I love creating
                        characters and interesting worlds for them to live in.
                        I write for pretty much every genre but I prefer writing Young Adult, the genre that inspired me
                        so much.
                        I have written multiple novels, short stories and novella's but the thing I am most proud of is
                        writing a trilogy.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p class="phob">
                        As mentioned, one of my favourite hobbies is naturally, playing video games and when I was
                        younger, I wanted to be able to develop games and write for them.
                        While, that job would be amazing, I know I can make a difference elsewhere. I still love gaming
                        and while I'm not exactly the best at it, or a harcore tryhard, I still try and play as many
                        games as I can.<br>
                        I also love swimming, and used to swim a lot and recently, I have been able to go back to
                        swimming and rekindle that love. It takes my mind off problems and I am always able to come up
                        with solutions to codes or beat troublesome bosses after a good swim <br>
                        Walking and visiting historical places are another thing I like to do. I enjoy going to castles
                        and walking around gardens, I've always had a passion for history and even volunteered to
                        archive literature at my university library.
                        Now that I live in Wales I've tried my hardest to take in the sites and gardens. It's a
                        beautiful country and I want to see more of it. <br>
                        I am also an amature baker, I adore baking and cooking. I am very much a try it and see cook, while I read recipes to get ideas I don't often follow them. 
                        Baking is a form of stress relief for me too, so I tend to bake often around assignment time much to the joy of everyone around me.
