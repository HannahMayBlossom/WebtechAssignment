            <h4>English Language and Literature</h4>
            <p class="english"> 
               My undergraduate degree was in English Language and Literature where my main focus was on Lingustics. <br>
               My dissertation was on Young Adult novels and whether the female main leads where 'good' role models for female readers. 
               By picking out key elements that both the novels I analysed shared, I created a list of adjectives and verbs used. 
               Then I used various linguistic analytical methods to discover which was a better role model. <br>
               Primarily, my focus was on feminism; how langauge was used and how it could be altered to greater effect. 
               Due to this, I was always intriguied how lagnuage can affect peoples views and how it was used to persuade others. <br>  
               I researched into lots of different areas of Lingustics. One area was children's fiction, and even got the oppotunity to go to a seminar on Children's Fiction. <br>
               I also had the amazing chance to do something different and research Science-Fiction and Fantasy novels, an area in lingustics and even literature that isn't commonly researched. 
               I enjoyed researching into tokenism and stylistics. <br>
               Naturally, as a literature student I read and anaylsed several different era's of novels, from Shakespeare, to Jane Austen and post-modernism. 
               While I enjoyed reading and anylsisng lots of material, I prefered the area of linguistics as allowed for a more interesting text-analysis. <br>   
            </p>
            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            <p class="computing">
                While I have not yet graduated for my Masters in Computer Science, I have learned a lot over my short time in the subject, and fell in love with it. After graduating, I want to learn more about the field and continue working in it. <br>
                My dissertation is in the field of Machine Learning mainly. While there are Learning Analytics features, as well as NLP, it's main focus will be on classifing key elements and predicting future behaviours and patterns.
                I decided it would be best to stick to a subject I am passionate about as well as something that stuck to my strengths. I adored Machine Learning and continued on learning it after my module had finished. So I decided to use this to figure out why there wasn't many women in STEM. 
                After searching online, I found that there could be several reasons why; from exposure to STEM, encouragement, and predisposition could be the root cause.  
                By using a large data set combined with case studies on women in STEM and women who aren't, I should be able to find a pattern and by result find out why women choose to go into STEM. <br>
                Other subjects I have studied are Python, my final project was to create several intricate fractals and create a GUI for them to be displayed. <br>
                I also learned how to use, create, and maintain a database using SQL, including how to create, a conceptual, logical and physical design.<br>
                Lastly, I also took the module, WebTech where I learned how to write html, and use CSS and JaveScript. <br>
                I found myself, enjoying Machine Learning the most and continued on learning it via, Advanced Machine Learning. All the different uses and capabilities drew me to the subject and I wanted to continue on learning more and what I could do with it.
                At the suggestion of one of my lecturers, I researched Learning Analytics as well as Learner Analytics and found myself looking deeper into those subjects as well. In the future, I plan to research more into these areas, using Machine Learning and everything I learned during this time. <br>

            <h3>Other Qualifications</h3>
            <h4>Tefl</h4>
            <p class="tefl">
                Lastly, I got a qualification in TEFL as being a teacher has always interested me and I wanted to persue it. Even when I started my masters I knew I still wanted to teach. I volunteered with Technocamps which made me want to revisit this area but with a computing background. 
                For me, I'd loved gaining this qualification and enjoyed persuing it and it helped me realise that I enjoyed teaching.  
            </p>
            <h4>Work Expierence</h4>
            <p class="workexp">
                I have worked in retail, in stores, which then lead to me volunteering part time at my university library. <br>
                I have also worked in the Healthcare department, as a Student Nurse and Healthcare assistant, and throughouly enjoyed helping others.
