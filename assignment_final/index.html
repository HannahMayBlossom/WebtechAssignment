            <h4>English Language and Literature</h4>
            <p class="english"> 
               My undergraduate degree was in English Language and Literature where my main focus was on Lingustics. <br>
               My dissertation was on Young Adult novels and whether the female main leads where 'good' role models for female readers.<br>
               Primarily, my focus was on feminism; how langauge was used and how it could be altered to greater effect. 
               Due to this, I was always intriguied how lagnuage can affect peoples views and how it was used to persuade others. <br>  
               I researched into lots of different areas of Lingustics. One area was children's fiction, and even got the oppotunity to go to a seminar on Children's Fiction. <br>
               I also had the amazing chance to do something different and research Science-Fiction and Fantasy novels, an area in lingustics and even literature that isn't commonly researched. 
               I enjoyed researching into tokenism and stylistics. <br> 
               Naturally, as a literature student I read and anaylsed several different era's of novels, from Shakespeare, to Jane Austen and post-modernism. 
               While I enjoyed reading and anylsisng lots of material, I prefered the area of linguistics as allowed for a more interesting text-analysis. <br>   
            </p>
            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            <p class="computing">
                While I have not yet graduated for my Masters in Computer Science, I have learned a lot over my short time in the subject, and fell in love with it. After graduating, I want to learn more about the field and continue working in it. <br>
                My dissertation is in the field of Machine Learning mainly. 
                By using a large data set combined with case studies on women in STEM and women who aren't, I should be able to find a pattern and by result find out why women choose to go into STEM. <br>
                Other subjects I have studied are Python, my final project was to create several intricate fractals and create a GUI for them to be displayed. <br>
                I also learned how to use, create, and maintain a database using SQL, including how to create, a conceptual, logical and physical design.<br>
                Lastly, I also took the module, WebTech where I learned how to write html, and use CSS and JaveScript. <br>
                I found myself, enjoying Machine Learning the most and continued on learning it via, Advanced Machine Learning. All the different uses and capabilities drew me to the subject and I wanted to continue on learning more and what I could do with it.
                At the suggestion of one of my lecturers, I researched Learning Analytics as well as Learner Analytics and found myself looking deeper into those subjects as well. In the future, I plan to research more into these areas, using Machine Learning and everything I learned during this time. <br>
            </p>
            <h4>Proofreading</h4>
            <p>
                I am available for proofreaeding any pieces of writing from academic to fiction and fun.
