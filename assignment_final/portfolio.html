                <h3>Lingustics Dissertation</h3>
                <p class="engdis">
                    My dissertation for my English Lingustics project was focused on feminism in Young Adult novels.<br>
                    The two novels I looked at where Twilight and Hunger Games. As a person who read them as a teenager
                    and adored Young Adult novels, I wanted to research into these more.
                    I wanted to use these two books in particular as they were a cultural phemonenon and inspired a
                    generation. <br>
                    By picking out key elements that both the novels I analysed shared, I created a list of adjectives
                    and verbs used.
                    Then I used various linguistic analytical methods to discover which was a better role model.
                    To add to my research, I created a questionnarie and gave it to many people of different age ranges.
                    While I focused on females between 13-18 I wanted to see if there was a difference from gender to
                    ages.
                    After I re-read these novels after coompiling my reserach, I found that my own opnion on these books
                    altered. I found that it was largely, the media and actress' who played the parts affected people's
                    opinion on the novels.
                    Neither novel is particularly well written, but from my research I found that Katniss is largely
                    unlikeable and it was the film portrayal of her that gained alot of appreciation.

                <h3>Machine Learning Dissertation</h3>
                <p class="compdis">
                    For my computing dissertation; I decided it would be best to stick to a subject I am passionate about as well as something that stuck to my strengths. I adored Machine Learning and continued on learning it after my module had finished. So I decided to use this to figure out why there wasn't many women in STEM.
                    This dissertation will use Machine Learning to discover why women do not choose to go into STEM subjects. 
                    I will classify key elements and predicting future behaviours and patterns from a data set as well as some case studies. 
                    After searching online, I found that there could be several reasons why; from exposure to STEM, encouragement, and predisposition could be the root cause. However, all research that had been done was Sociological and not Computer Science. 
                    I wanted to discover whether there was a pattern and hopefully, inspire more women to go into STEM if I found the reason why they did not.

                <h3>Python Fractcal Art</h3>
                <p class="pythonpro">
                    For my first, daunting, major project for the course, I was asked to create several pieces of fractal art of my own design with a visual interface.<br> 
                    I decided to use the seasons to be the inspiration for my art. I created four different pieces of art using four different techniques and styles. 
                    I made a GUI using Tkinter with simple buttons that drew the art when a button was clicked.

                <h3>Website Project</h3>
                <p class="webtech">
                    For my webtech final project, I created this website and I continue to alter and add to it even after the project was handed in.

                    <h4>Tefl</h4>
                    <p class="tefl">
                        Lastly, I got a qualification in TEFL as being a teacher has always interested me and I wanted
                        to persue it. Even when I started my masters I knew I still wanted to teach. I volunteered with
                        Technocamps which made me want to revisit this area but with a computing background.
                        For me, I'd loved gaining this qualification and enjoyed persuing it and it helped me realise
                        that I enjoyed teaching.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Work Expierence</h4>
                    <p class="workexp">
                        I have worked in retail, in stores, which then lead to me volunteering part time at my
                        university library. <br>
                        I have also worked in the Healthcare department, as a Student Nurse and Healthcare assistant,
